# test-perl
Testing Perl (a.k.a., reminding myself about Perl)

# Synopsis

```
$ prove -l
```

# Description
Tests vanilla Perl as well as different Perl modules to help my understanding
and provide myself with a future reference. Rather than creating one-off
scripts to scratch an itch, I will try and properly organise everything inside
this repository.
